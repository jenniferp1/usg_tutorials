With the growing interconnectedness of critical

infrastructures on ICT, the selection of a target that allows the

maximum level of disruption would significantly influence the

terrorists. Motivation is about influencing human beings and

the decisions they make. Motivation forces behind cyber

terrorism are social, political and belief. Cyber terrorists can

exploit vulnerabilities over a targeted system through a vast

array of intrusive tools and techniques. The method of attack

could be through network warfare and psychological warfare.

Cyberspace is the domain in which a terrorist-type attack is

conducted. Cyber terrorists employ unlawful use of force or

unlawful attacks to conduct the premeditated attack. The
