    "Knowing pandas is a great introduction to more powerful and complex data analysis. However, learning to use Python and pandas can seem challenging because there is no point-and-click user interface like in Excel. \n",

    "# Defintions\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Excel</u>: Excel is a spreadsheet software, containing data in tabular form. Entries of the data are located in cells, with numbered rows and letter labeled columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Pandas</u>: The Python package pandas is a great alternative to Excel, providing much of the same functionality and more. Pandas is great for data manipulation, cleaning, analysis, and exploration. Additionally, these tasks can be easily automated and reapplied to different datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>DataFrame</u>: The equivalent to an Excel spreadsheet in pandas is the DataFrame. It looks like a spreadsheet, with rows, columns, and indices. In other words, a “table” of data is stored in a DataFrame. We can create a DataFrame from scratch, or more commonly, import the data from an Excel or csv file.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Pivot Table</u> A pivot table is a table that summarizes data in another table, and is made by applying an operation such as sorting, averaging, or summing to data in the first table, typically including grouping of the data. Data stored in one table or spreadsheet is sorted, counted, totaled or averaged.  The results of this process are then displayed in a second table — the pivot table — showing the summarized data.\n",
