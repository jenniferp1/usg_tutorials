                               Recently, there has been an emergence of literature on the mechanisms through which parents transmit
                               information, values, and perspectives about ethnicity and race to their children, commonly referred to as
                               racial or ethnic socialization. This literature has sought to document the nature of such socialization, its
                               antecedents in parents' and children's characteristics and experiences, and its consequences for children's
                               well-being and development. In this article, the authors integrate and synthesize what is known about
                               racial and ethnic socialization on the basis of current empirical research, examining studies concerning
                               its nature and frequency; its child, parent, and ecological predictors; and its consequences for children's
                               development, including ethnic identity, self-esteem, coping with discrimination, academic achievement,
                               and psychosocial well-being. The authors also discuss conceptual and methodological limitations of the
                               literature and suggest directions for future research.
