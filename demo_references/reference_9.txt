                                                       sources will have important repercussions on our understanding of the behaviour of gravity in the
                                                       highly non-linear relativistic regime, the distribution and interaction of massive black holes at high
                                                       redshift and the formation and evolution of cosmic structures. It is therefore important to address
                                                       how accurately LISA can measure the source parameters and explore the implications for astronomy
                                                       and cosmology.

                                                          Present observations and theoretical models suggest that massive black holes could be spinning,
                                                       possibly rapidly in some cases. In binary systems, the relativistic spin-orbit interaction causes the
                                                       orbital plane to precess in space producing a characteristic signature on the emitted gravitational
                                                       waves. In this paper we investigate the effect of spins on the gravitational wave signal registered at
                                                       the LISA output ­ we provide ready-to-use analytical expressions of the measured signal ­ and the
                                                       implications for parameter estimation. We consider the in-spiral phase of binary systems in circular
                                                       orbit undergoing the so-called "simple precession" and we approximate the gravitational radiation
                                                       at the restricted post1.5-Newtonian order. We show that the presence of spins changes dramatically
                                                       the signature of the signal recorded by LISA. As a consequence, the mean square errors associated
                                                       to the parameter measurements are significantly smaller than the ones obtained when the effect of
                                                       spins is neglected. For a binary system of two 106 M black holes, the angular resolution and the
                                                       relative error on the luminosity distance improve by a factor  3-to-10; the fractional errors on the
                                                       chirp mass and the reduced mass decrease by a factor  10 and  103, respectively.

                                        Binary systems of massive black holes in the mass range 107 M - 105 M are among the most spectacular sources
                                     that will be observed by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), an ESA/NASA space-borne laser interfer-
                                     ometer aimed at observations of gravitational waves (GW's) in the low-frequency region of the spectrum  10-5 Hz -
                                     0.1 Hz, and expected to be launched in 2011 [1]. The interest in the detection of gravitational radiation from massive
                                     black holes (MBH's) is two-fold [2]: (i) for fundamental physics, because it will provide a thorough understanding
                                     of the behaviour of strong gravity in the highly non-linear relativistic regime, and (ii) for astronomy and cosmology
                                     because GW's provide an "orthogonal" and complementary mean, with respect to conventional astronomy, of inves-
                                     tigating the high-redshift formation and evolution of cosmic structures, such as galaxy interactions and mergers, and
                                     exploring the demography of massive black holes.

                                        Massive black holes (MBH's) are considered to be essentially ubiquitous in the centre of galaxies in the local and
                                     low-redshift Universe [3, 4]. Our Galaxy [5] and NGC 4258 [6] provide probably the most solid observational evidence
                                     for the existence of such black holes [7]. The evidence for the presence of black holes in galaxies at high redshift is
                                     more circumstantial, but the fact that galaxies, at some stage of their life, harbour AGN's, and we observe quasars
                                     at z > 6 [8] strongly favour the hypothesis that black holes are fairly common also at high redshift. This conclusion
                                     is supported by recent results [9] that show that the high-redshift quasar distribution and the present day density
                                     of black holes can be reconciled by invoking galaxy mergers where the relation between host velocity dispersion and
                                     black hole mass is consistent with the one observed locally [10]. The present day population of MBH's is therefore
                                     likely to be the dormant remnant of those earlier activities. Two black holes are brought together at the centre of a
                                     merger remnant by dynamical friction from the stars of the common host. The further evolution of a binary must
                                     then take place on a time scale short enough for the system to coalesce within an Hubble time due to radiation
                                     reaction. Two are the main mechanisms that could make the binary hard enough to satisfy this condition: dynamical
                                     friction from stars in the core [11, 12, 13, 14, 15] and gas dynamical effects [16, 17]. However, despite all these
                                     circumstantial evidences, the rate of coalescence of massive black hole binaries in the Universe is still controversial:
                                     present astrophysical estimations vary widely from  0.1 yr-1 to  100 yr-1 [11, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24], depending
                                     on model assumptions and BH mass range. At present there are no direct observational evidences for the presence of
                                     massive black holes binary systems, with the possible exception of OJ287 [25].

                                        LISA will be able to detect MBH binaries at a moderate-to-high signal-to-noise ratio throughout the entire Universe
                                     (redshift z  10 and beyond, if black holes are already present). During the whole LISA observational campaign ­
                                     the nominal duration of the mission is 3 years, but the instrument is expected to operate for about 10 years, if no
                                     catastrophic failure occurs on the spacecraft ­ one can therefore expect from a handful to a very large number of
                                                                                                                                                         2

detections.
   LISA is an all-sky monitor. At any one time, the instrument maps the whole sky, although with a different

sensitivity depending on the location of the source and the polarisation of the waves. By coherently tracking the
phase and amplitude evolution of GW's, one can extract precise information about a source. In observations of binary
systems, the number of parameters on which the waveform depends, and that one needs to extract from the data, is
large, in the most general case 17. Clearly correlations among parameters are inevitable, degrading the precision of
the measurements.

   A few studies have been carried out so far to address how accurately LISA can measure the source parameters and
the implications for astronomy and cosmology. Because of the complexity of the problem and open theoretical issues
in the modelling of the gravitational waveform in the most general case, assumptions, possibly ad-hoc, have been
introduced on the waveform model. Cutler [26] has considered the in-spiral phase of binary systems approximating
the waveform at the restricted post1.5-Newtonian order. Sintes and collaborators [27, 28] and Moore and Hellings [29]
have investigated the parameter estimation including post2-Newtonian corrections to the amplitude and the phase.
Hughes [30] has considered restricted post2-Newtonian waveforms for the in-spiral phase and has included the ring-
down portion of the signal; more recently Seto has included the effect of the finite length of the LISA arms using
restricted post1.5-Newtonian waveforms [31]. All these analysis have a priori assumed that black holes have no spins, or
the spins are parallel to each other and the orbital angular momentum. However, present astrophysical observations
and theoretical models suggest that massive black holes are likely to be rotating, possibly rapidly in some cases.
Observations of AGN's and quasars are highly consistent with rapidly rotating black holes; observations of black holes
in quiescence are in agreement with a slow, if any, rotation and some theoretical models suggest small-to-moderate
spins (see, e.g., [32]). If there is little doubt that black holes are, in general, rotating, how strong spins are is to a
large extent unknown. Quite likely, gravitational wave observations shall provide the most effective tool in addressing
this issue. Spins are likely to add vast complexity to the signal recorded at the detector output, and require more
parameters to describe the waveform [33, 34, 35, 36]. In this paper we show that spins do change dramatically the
structure of the signal observed by LISA and, as a consequence, affect significantly (even by orders of magnitudes for
some selected parameters) the errors with which LISA can measure the source parameters.

   In this paper we restrict our attention to the in-spiral phase of massive binary systems of comparable mass. We
consider circular orbits, model the waveform at the restricted post1.5-Newtonian order and assume that binary systems
undergo the so-called simple precession [33], which is the relevant scenario from an astrophysical viewpoint. The goal
of the paper is two fold: (i) to provide ready to use analytical expressions for the LISA detector output when binary
systems undergo spin-orbit precession, and (ii) to show the dramatic change in parameter estimation that occurs when
spin-orbit modulation in phase and amplitude is taken into account. The actual parameter space is so vast ­ the
waveform is described by 12 parameters ­ that here we concentrate on typical systems of two 106 M black holes. A
thorough exploration of the whole parameter space requires large-scale, CPU-intensive Monte-Carlo simulations and
is beyond the scope of this paper; such analysis is currently in progress and will be reported in a separate paper [37].

   The organisation of the paper is as follows. In section II we review the main features of the LISA mission, in
particular its orbital configuration which is central for the topic discussed in this paper. In Section III we review the
main properties and key equations regarding the emission of GW's from in-spiralling binary systems, with emphasis
on the role plaid by spins, and we stress the differences with respect to the non-spinning, i.e. non-precessing, case.
Section IV and V contain the key results of the paper. In Section IV we derive explicit ready-to-use analytical
expressions for the signal measured at the LISA detector output for binary systems in circular orbit that undergo
simple precession; the waveform is computed within the restricted post1.5-Newtonian approximation. In section V we
explore the errors with which the twelve parameters of the signal can be determined and compare the results with
the case where spins are neglected. In Section VI we summarise our conclusions and present pointers to future work.

   In this section we review the main properties of the LISA mission. We refer the reader to [1] for more details.

                                                                      A. The LISA orbit

   LISA is an all-sky monitor with a quadrupolar antenna pattern. Its orbital configuration is conceived in order to
keep the geometry of the interferometer as stable as possible during the mission, which in turn provides a thorough
coverage of the whole sky: a constellation of three drag-free spacecraft (containing the "free-falling test masses") is
placed at the vertexes of an ideal equilateral triangle with sides  5 × 106 km; it forms a three-arms interferometer,
with a 60 angle between two adjacent laser beams. The LISA orbital motion is as follows: the barycentre of the
                                                                                                                                                   3

instrument follows an essentially circular heliocentric orbit, 20 behind the Earth; the detector plane is tilted by 60
with respect to the Ecliptic and the instrument counter-rotates around the normal to the detector plane with the
same period 1 yr.

   Following [26] we introduce two Cartesian reference frames [38]: (i) a fixed "barycentric" frame (x, y, z) tied to the
Ecliptic and centred in the Solar System Barycentre, with ^z perpendicular to the Ecliptic, and the plane (x, y) in
the Ecliptic itself; (ii) a detector reference frame (x, y, z), centred in the LISA centre of mass and attached to the
detector, with ^z perpendicular to the plane defined by the three arms and the x and y axis defined so that the unit
vectors ^lj (j = 1, 2, 3) along each arm read

                                      ^lj = cos          +     (j  -   1)  x^ + sin          +      (j  -  1)  y^ .                                (1)

In the Ecliptic frame the motion of LISA's centre-of-mass is described by the polar angles

                                                                       =        ,
                                                                             2

                                                               (t) = 0 + nt ,                                                                      (2)

where

                                                                    n        2     ,                                                               (3)
                                                                             1 yr

and 0 sets the position of the detector at same arbitrary reference time. The normal to the detector plane ^z precesses
around ^z according to

    The time evolution of the unit vectors ^lj (j = 1, 2, 3) along each arm is described by the following expression [26]:

                            ^lj =     1    sin j(t)   cos (t) -        cos j(t)    sin (t)      x^

where j(t) increases linearly with time, according to                                                                                              (6)
                                                        j(t) = nt - (j - 1)/3 + 0 ,

and 0 is just a constant specifying the orientation of the arms at the arbitrary reference time t = 0.

In  Eq.  (7)  F+()(t)  and  F×()(t)   are  the  time  dependent       antenna      patters   and   the     factor         =  sin(/3)  comes  from  the
                                                                                                                     3/2

60 opening angle of the LISA arms. F+ and F× vary with time because during the observation the interferometer

changes orientation with respect to the source; in fact, in-spiral binaries are long-lived sources in the low frequency

band. The index  = I, II labels the two independent Michelson outputs that can be constructed from the readouts

of the three arms if the noise is uncorrelated and "totally symmetric" [26]. They are equivalent to the outputs of two

identical interferometers in the same location, rotated by 45 one with respect to the other.
   The functions describing the interferometer beam pattern depend on the source location in the sky N^ (GW's

propagate in the -N^ direction) and wave polarisation, which is related to the orientation of the orbital plane, and

therefore the orbital angular momentum L^, with respect to the detector. With respect to the frame tied to the Solar
                                                                                                                 4

system barycentre, N^ and L^ are described by the polar angles (N , N ) and (L , L). Equivalently, in the frame
attached to the detector, N^ and L^ are identified by the angles (N , N ) and (L , L). In the reference frame attached
to LISA, the antenna beam patters read

       F+  (N  , N  N )   =   1   (1  +  cos N2 ) cos 2N           cos 2N     -     cos N  sin 2N     sin 2N  ,  (8a)

       F×  (N  , N  N )   =   1   (1  +  cos N2 ) cos 2N           sin 2N     +     cos N  sin 2N     cos 2N  ,  (8b)
                              2

where N describes the "polarisation angle" of the waveform in the detector frame. The antenna patterns (8a)
and (8b) for the two outputs  = I and  = II are therefore

           III. GRAVITATIONAL WAVES FROM BINARY SYSTEMS

   In this section we briefly review, partly to fix notation, the basic concepts and formulae regarding the emission of
gravitational waves by binary systems, with emphasis on the effects produced by spins. We refer the reader to [33, 34]
for details and to [39] and references therein for a thorough review regarding post-Newtonian gravitational waveforms.

   The whole coalescence of a binary system is usually divided in three distinct phases [40]: (i) the adiabatic in-spiral,
during which the BH orbital evolution occurs on the time-scale of the gravitational radiation reaction, which is much
longer than the orbital period; (ii) the merger, which takes place at the end of the in-spiral when the binary orbit
becomes relativistically unstable and the black holes enter a free fall plunge; and (iii) the ring-down, when the resulting
BH settles down in its final stationary Kerr state, oscillating according to its normal modes. In this paper we consider
only the in-spiral phase. In fact the time to coalescence for a system radiating at frequency f is:

             1.2 × 107                f -8/3                    M (1 + z) -5/3                  -1               (14)
                                  10-4 Hz                        106 M                    0.25
                                                                                                    sec ,

where M and  are the total mass and the symmetric mass ratio, respectively, defined in Eqs. (16b)-(16e),  is the

observed life-time of a binary system as recorded in the solar system for a source at redshift z with intrinsic total mass
M that enters the detector window at the observed frequency f = 10-4 Hz. Binary systems are therefore long-lived in

the LISA band, and one critically relies on long integration times to disentangle the sources parameters, in particular

to resolve the source position in the sky and measure its luminosity distance [26].
                                                                                  5

   As we consider only the in-spiral phase of the coalescence, in the frequency domain we shut-off the signal at
frequency

                fisco   =             1
                              63/2M (1 + z)

                         4.4 × 10-3             M (1 + z)  -1                     (15)
                                                 106 M
                                                               Hz ,

which corresponds to the innermost stable circular orbit of a particle orbiting a Schwarzichild black hole (ISCO). The
real transition from in-spiral to merger will occur at a frequency somewhat (by a factor < 2) different from fisco, but
due to the difficulty of defining the ISCO we will adopt the value (15). The results presented in this paper are anyway
essentially unaffected by changing the cut-off frequency by a small factor.

   We also assume the orbit to be circular. This is completely reasonable from an astrophysical point of view, as
a massive binary system of roughly equal mass black holes has enough time ­ regardless of the initial eccentricity

at which it forms ­ to circularise before it enters the observational window, due to dynamical friction and radiation
reaction [12, 41].

                A. The amplitude and phase evolution

   We consider two massive black holes of mass m1 and m2, and spins S1 and S2, respectively. Several mass parameters
are actually useful:

                        M = m1 + m2 ,                                             (16a)
                                                                                  (16b)
                         µ    =    m1 m2     ,
                                     M                                            (16c)
                                                                                  (16d)
                        M = µ3/5 M 2/5 = M 3/5 ,                                  (16e)

                              =    =  µ   ;
                                      M

they represent, respectively, the total mass, the reduced mass, the chirp mass and the symmetric mass ratio.
   The system evolves by loosing energy and angular momentum through emission of gravitational waves of increasing

frequency and amplitude. The emitted radiation is given by the superposition of harmonics at multiples of the orbital
period, and the two independent polarisation amplitudes h+ and h× [42] can be schematically represented as [43]

                  h+,×(t) =               H+(k,)×(t) ei k orb(t)  ,               (17)

                                       k

where H+(k,)× are time dependent functions of the source parameters and orb(t) is the binary orbital phase. The
strongest harmonic is associated to the quadrupole moment of the source, and therefore corresponds to k = 2. In
this paper we consider the so-called restricted post-Newtonian approximation to the radiation (17): we retain only
the leading order contribution to the amplitude, therefore only H+(2,)× at the Newtonian order, and take into account
post-Newtonian corrections only to the phase of the signal (t) = 2 orb(t). In this approximation Eq. (17) reads:

           h+     =  2  M5/3     1 + L^ · N^ 2 ( f )2/3 cos (t) ,                 (18a)
                         DL                                                       (18b)

           h×     =  -4  M5/3      L^ · N^ ( f )2/3 sin (t) ,
                          DL

where DL is the source luminosity distance [44], N^ the unit vector pointing toward the binary centre of mass (in our
convention the GW propagation direction is -N^ ) and L^ the orbital angular momentum unit vector.

   We review now the expression for the GW phase (t). The signal frequency f , twice the orbital one, evolves

according to [45]

tc and c, the time and phase at coalescence, are constants of integration, defined as the value of t and  at (formally)
f = . As we mentioned, massive black holes spend months-to-years in the LISA observational window, depending
on the mass. For future reference, if we assume that LISA observes the final year of in-spiral of a binary, then the

which we call "arrival" (or "initial") frequency, and fisco. An interesting quantity to consider is the total number of
gravitational wave cycles recorded by the detector:

                                   N (t) = 1            t                                                         (25)

From Eq. (23) and (24), it is easy to compute the number of cycles in the final year of in-spiral:

   Present observations and theoretical prejudices suggest that massive black holes could be rapidly rotating. As we
have mentioned in the previous section, if black holes are spinning then the GW phase (23) contains two additional
terms, one at the 1.5PN order, which is proportional to , and the other at the 2PN order, which is proportional
to . However spins introduce a much more dramatic effect in the structure of the waveform, which is qualitatively
different from the ones just mentioned: the orbital angular momentum L and the spins S1 and S2 change orientation
due to spin-orbit interaction (1.5PN effect), so that the radiation detected has a time varying polarisation. L, S1 and
S2 precess, over a time scale longer than the orbital period (2/f  30 min) but shorter than the observation time
( 1 yr), around the (almost) fixed direction of the total angular momentum L + S1 + S2. This effect is actually quite
dramatic and drastically changes the signature of the detected signal, as the orientation of the orbital plane changes

TABLE I: Summary of the frequency band swept by massive black hole binary systems and the number of wave cycles recorded

at the detector output in LISA observations for selected masses and integration times. The table shows the initial and final

frequency of the GW's, fa and fisco respectively, the corresponding time of observation Tobs, and the number of waves cycles

recored at the output of the detector, coming from the various contributions of the terms in Eq. (23): Newtonian: the first
term; post1-Newtonian (1PN): the second term, proportional to ( M f )2/3; tail: -10  ( M f ); spin-orbit: (5/2)  ( M f );
post2-Newtonian (2PN): the last term, proportional to ( M f )4/3 with  = 0; spin-spin: the -5  ( M f )4/3 term. The
sources are selected with masses in the range 107 M - 105 M; for each mass choice, three different fa's are considered: the

first corresponds to Tobs =1 yr, which does depend on m1 and m2, whereas the other two are the same for all m1 and m2, and
correspond to fa = 5 × 10-5 Hz , and 10-4 Hz, respectively. Notice that depending on fa, m1 and m2, systems are observable

for different times. The fiducial source is at z = 1.

during the year long observation time, and the angular momenta complete several precession cycles around the fixed

detection.

   The spin-orbit induced precession is the key new physical effect which is introduced in this paper. Here we review

the main concepts and expressions and refer the reader to [33, 34] for more details. In this paper we restrict our
attention to the so-called simple precession [33], which takes place when (i) the BH masses are equal (m1  m2),
or (ii) one of the BH's has negligible spin (for convention, in this paper we shall assume S2 = 0). Furthermore,
one needs to impose the condition that the angular momenta are oriented so that L = -(S1 + S2). Under this

assumptions the equations that describe the evolution of the angular momenta simplify considerably, and one can

construct explicit analytical solutions for the relevant quantities. Moreover the regime that we consider is well justified

form an astrophysical point of view.
   For circular orbits through the post1.5-Newtonian order the equations describing the evolution of L, S1 and S2 read

is the conserved total angular momentum [46, 47] (indeed L = -S ).

   Following [33], we highlight the main features of simple precession and provide, in a ready-to-use form, the relevant
quantities needed for the computation of the LISA detector output. We will neglect the post2-Newtonian corrections,
while retaining the post1.5-Newtonian terms (spin-orbit), which are dominant, for the m1 = m2 case; they vanish
anyway for S2 = 0 [33, 34].

   One can summarise the main features of the simple precession as follows. J^, L^ and S^ precess with the same angular

velocity

Notice that the precession cycles accumulate at low frequency, and, for L  S, Np does not depend on S; if L  S,
Np  (m1/m2)  1 which could therefore generate a very large number of precessions. In Table II we show the
number of precession cycles Np and the value of the precession frequency p at fa and fisco for a number of choices
of the mass of a binary system.

   Using Eq. (32) we define now the precession angle  as

In Eq. (47) the angle c is a constant of integration that essentially identifies the position of L^ and S^ on the precession
cone at the reference time tc. Finally, the frequency evolution of L ­ the angle between L^ and J^ changes with time

­ is given by:

   Notice that at the 1.5PN order, which corresponds to the the post-Newtonian order at which we model the waveform
in this paper, the contribution of the spins to the GW phase (23) depends only on the parameter . However, if
one takes into account the change of orientation of the angular momenta, then the spin-orbit coupling is described
by three parameters, say c,  and S, on which  depends. In the implementation of the computation of the Fisher
information matrix, cf Sec. V, we found convenient to use as independent parameters ,  and c.

                                                           IV. THE OBSERVED SIGNAL

   We can now derive ready-to-use analytical expressions for the signal measured by LISA at the Michelson detector
output, Eq. (7), when the source is an in-spiralling binary system of spinning massive black holes. In this case, due
to the relativistic spin-orbit coupling, the binary angular momenta, L, S1 and S2, precess, following the equations
described in Sec.III B. It is worth spelling out the assumption under which the signal is derived: (i) the binary is
in circular orbit; (ii) the waveform is modelled using the restricted post1.5-Newtonian approximation (amplitude at
the lowest quadrupole Newtonian contribution, and GW phase at the 1.5PN order); (iii) the masses and/or spins are
such that the system undergoes "simple precession".

   In the most general case the signal depends on 17 parameters: 2 mass parameters, 6 parameters related to the BH
spins ­ the magnitude and orientation of each spin ­ the orbital eccentricity, the luminosity distance (which is a direct
observable in GW astronomy), 2 angles identifying the location of the source in the sky, two angles that describe the
orientation of the orbital plane, one angle that describes the orientation of the ellipse in the orbital plane, an arbitrary
reference time, say the time at coalescence, and the signal phase at that time. In the approximation that we consider
here the signal depends on 12 unknown parameters (cf the next section for more details). The key new qualitative
feature that we introduce here and that is not present in any of the previous analysis [26, 27, 29, 30] is the change
of orientation of the orbital angular momentum during the observation. Unlike the model considered in [27, 29], here
we consider only the waves emitted at twice the orbital frequency.

   Before providing the explicit expression for h(t), it is worth summarising the key motions and the associated time
scales that affect the detector output:

    · LISA orbits around the Sun, so that the barycentre of the instrument changes position over the timescale of
       one sidereal year: this motion Doppler-shifts the incoming gravitational waves, and depends only on the source
       position in the sky;

    · The orientation of the LISA arms changes over the same time scale because the detector precesses around the
       normal to the Ecliptic: this introduces a phase and amplitude modulation which is due to the time-dependent
       response of the detector to the two orthogonal polarisations h+ and h×; this effect depends on both the position
       and orientation of the source in the sky.

    · The binary orbital plane changes orientation in the sky with L and S that precess around the total angular
       momentum J, whose direction is essentially constant. The time scale of precession is longer than the orbital
       period but much shorter than the LISA rotation time-scale and depends on both the source-detector relative
       orientation and the binary physical parameters (masses and spins): the incoming GW's are therefore intrinsically
       modulated in amplitude and phase.

   We consider first the representation of detector output in the time domain h()(t); we will then turn to the frequency
domain representation h~()(f ).

                               A. The measured signal in the time domain

   In the amplitude-and-phase representation, the signal h()(t), cf Eq. (7), measured by the -th Michelson LISA
interferometer and produced by the polarisation amplitudes (18a) and (18b) reads

                            h()(t) = A(t) A(p)(t) cos (t) + p(t) + p()(t) + D(t) .                  (49)

FIG. 1: The evolution of the polarisation amplitude (left panels) and phase (right panels), computed according to Eqs. (50)

and (51), for the final year of in-spiral of a binary system as a function of time. The bold solid-line refers to black holes with no
spin, the dotted-line (for the phase) and thin solid-line (for the amplitude) to spinning objects. The relevant source parameters
are chosen as follows: m1 = 107 M, m2 = 105 M, S/m2 = 0.95 and S^ · L^ = 0.5 (top panels), and m1 = m2 = 106 M,
S/m2 = 0.3, and S^ · L^ = 0.9 (bottom panels). The location and initial orientation of the source have been chosen randomly.

is the Doppler phase modulation induced by the motion of the LISA detector around the Sun; p(t) is the so-called
Thomas precession phase, Eq. (36), which vanishes for spin-less binary systems; the amplitude of the gravitational

wave signal is

          A[t(f  )]  =  2   M5/3  [ f (t)]2/3  ,   (53)
                              D

and the GW phase (t) is given by Eq.(23), where at the 1.5PN order one neglects the term proportional to (M f )4/3.
   The structure of h()(t) clearly shows that the signal measured at the detector output is phase and amplitude

modulated because of the three effects that we have mentioned above: (ii) the orbital motion of the instrument

around the Sun which Doppler-modulates, through D, the phase of the incoming gravitational wave signal; this
effect is the same for h(I) and h(II); (ii) the change of orientation of the detector during the time of observation
that through F+()(t) and F×()(t) affects A(p) and p(), in different ways depending on ; (iii) the change of L^ due to
spin-orbit interaction which affects A(p) and (p) through (N^ · L^) and N , cf. Eqs. (8a), (8b), (12), (50) and (51); the
impinging signal is intrinsically modulated. Furthermore p adds to the phase of the signal.

   In order to complete the analysis of the detector output, we need to provide explicit expressions for (L^ · N^ ), which

enters Eq. (50) and (51), and (L^ · ^z) and [N^ · (L^ × ^z)] that are needed to compute N , Eq. (12), and therefore the

                                   2

   Lastly, we need to compute the scalar and vector products necessary to derive the Thomas precession phase p(t),
Eqs. (36) and (37):

     (L^ × N^ ) · L^ = p cos L (N^ · L^) - (N^ · J^0) -  J^0 · (L^ × N^ ) ,                                                (65)

                          sin J                                                    sin J

p(t) can be therefore computed using Eqs. (47), (48a), (48b), (54), (58), (59) and (60).
   An example of the LISA output when black holes rapidly spin is shown in Figure 1, where we plot the amplitude

and phase modulation, Eqs (50) and (51), during the final year of in-spiral. Two cases are actually presented: a
binary system with m1 = 107 M, m2 = 105 M, S/m2 = 0.95 and S^ · L^ = 0.5 and an equal mass binary where the
parameters correspond to m1 = m2 = 106 M, S/m2 = 0.3, and S^ · L^ = 0.9. The evolution of Ap(t) and p(t) for
the two sets of physical parameters is compared to the spin-less case. A simple eye inspection shows how dramatic is

the effect induced by spins, and it should therefore not come as a surprise the fact that the errors associated to the

measurements of the source parameters are strongly affected.

                         B. The measured signal in the frequency domain

   For several applications in data analysis, it is often more useful to work in the frequency domain, and we will derive
now an approximation to the Fourier representation of the signal h()(t), Eq.(49). Our convention for the Fourier

transform g~(f ) of any real function g(t) is:

                                                        e2ift g(t) dt .

                                           g~(f ) =                                                        (67)

                                                     -

   The Fourier transform (67) of the signal h()(t) can be computed in an rather straightforward way using the
stationary phase approximation, see [52], and considering the gravitational waveform A(t) cos (t) in Eq. (49) as the
carrier signal modulated by the motion of the detector and the source's orbital plane [26, 33]. Under this assumption,
the Fourier transform of the detector output (49) reads:

       h~()(f )   A A(p)[t(f )] f -7/6 e{i [(f )-(p)[t(f )]-D[t(f )]-p[t(f )]]}            0 < f  fisco ,  (68)

   In this section we discuss the errors associated to the parameter measurement when LISA monitors binary systems
of rapidly rotating massive black holes in circular orbit. We start by briefly recalling the general concepts and formulae
regarding parameter estimation ­ we refer the reader to [48, 49, 50, 51, 52] and references therein for more details ­
and then present the results of our analysis applied to LISA data.

                     A. Review of signal analysis and parameter estimation

The signal s(t) registered at the detector output is the superposition of noise n(t) and gravitational waves h(t; ):

                                              s(t) = h(t; ) + n(t) ;                                       (71)

 represents the vector of the unknown parameters (location, masses, spins, etc.) that characterise the actual wave-
form and that one wishes to estimate from the data stream. We assume the noise to be stationary and Gaussian,
characterised by a noise spectral density Sn(f ). In the geometrical approach to signal processing it is useful to consider
s(t) as a vector in the signal vector space, and to introduce the following inner product between two signals v and
w [52]:

                                 (v|w) = 2        v~(f )w~(f ) + v~(f )w~(f )  df .                        (72)

                                              0           Sn(f )

According to the definition (72), the optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at which h can be detected is

                                        S/N   =     (h|h)     =  (h|h)1/2  .                               (73)
                                                 rms[(h|n)]
                                                                                                 15

In this paper we discuss the errors associated to the measurement of the unknown parameter vector  that characterises
the signal h(t; ). In the limit of large SNR, which is clearly the case for LISA observations of massive black hole
binary systems, the errors  follow a Gaussian probability distribution:

       det()     1/2  1   jk j k
         2            2
p() =                 e .-                                                                       (74)

In Eq.(74) the matrix jk is known as the Fisher information matrix, and reads

       j(k)      h() h()  .                                                                      (75)
                 j k

The variance-covariance matrix is simply given by the inverse of the Fisher information matrix:

jk = j k =            ()  -1  jk                                                                 (76)

                                 .

The matrix  contains full information about the parameter errors and their correlations, and is what we need to
compute (cf next Section) in order to investigate the LISA parameter estimation. In fact the diagonal elements of 
represent the expected mean squared errors

       (j )2 = jj ,                                                                              (77)

and its off-diagonal elements provide information about the correlations among different parameters through the
correlation coefficients cjk:

cjk =  jk        (-1  cjk  +1) .                                                                 (78)
          jj kk

In the limit of high signal-to-noise ratio, jj provides a tight lower bound to the minimum mean-squared error
 (j )2 the so-called Cramer-Rao bound [49, 50]. It is important to notice that the errors (77) and the correlation

coefficients (78) depend both on the actual value of the signal parameter vector . For the case of observations with
two or more detectors with uncorrelated noise, the Fisher information matrix is simply: jk =  (jk).

   One of the properties that we are interested in is the angular resolution of the instrument, which we define as:

N = 2   cos N2   N2   -  cos N N 2                                             1/2               (79)

                                                                                   ;

The physical meaning of N is the following: the probability of the source to lie outside an (appropriately shaped)
error ellipse enclosing a solid angle  is simply e-/N .

                                                                   B. LISA observations

   We discuss now how accurately LISA can measure the source parameters in the case of rapidly spinning black holes.
The goal of this section is to investigate whether spins, which have been neglected in studies carried out so far, can
significantly affect the estimation of the source parameters. A thorough exploration of this effect requires to probe a
very large multi-dimensional parameter space, and it is well outside of the scope of this paper. Here we concentrate
on a fiducial source of two 106 M black holes at redshift z = 1 ­ a rather typical LISA source ­ and we compare the
errors associated to the parameter measurements in the case in which spins are present ­ for large spins, S/M 2 = 0.95,
and moderate spins S/M 2 = 0.3; in both cases  = 0.9 ­ and the case where spins are neglected (the black holes are
considered, a priory, to be not spinning).

   Before presenting the results we spell out the assumptions under which we compute the errors (77):

    · The orbit is circular; we regard such hypothesis as realistic, as we are dealing with massive systems of black holes
       of comparable mass. As the orbit shrinks due to dynamical friction the eccentricity is likely to decrease [11, 12, 13]
       and radiation reaction completes the circularisation process before GW's enter the observational window of LISA;
       in fact the eccentricity e evolves according to e  f -19/18 [41].
                                     16

· The black holes are spinning, so that the binary orbit precesses in space. However, in oder to simplify the
  description of the precession motion, still addressing a realistic astrophysical scenario, we assume that either
  m1 = m2 (the case considered in this paper) or S2 = 0 and the spins and angular momentum are not anti-aligned.
  Under this conditions a binary undergoes the so-called simple precession [33], and the equations describing the
  evolution of the relevant physical quantities simplify considerably (cf Sec. III B for more details).

· We restrict the analysis only to the in-spiral phase of the whole coalescence. We approximate the waveform
  ~h()(f ; ) at the restricted 1.5PN order. The GW signal detected at the LISA output is therefore described

  by Eqs. (68), (69), and (70). Because we retain terms up to 1.5PN order in the GW phase, in the expression
  of (f ), Eq. (70), we neglect the last term proportional to (M f )4/3. We shut-off the in-spiral waveform at

  the frequency fisco, given by Eq. (15). In the computation of the errors (77) we actually neglect the Thomas
  precession phase p(t), Eq. (36). This simplification is motived by computational reasons, and does not affect in
  any significant way the final results. In fact, p[t(f )] must be computed numerically at each frequency using the
  past history of the binary; p[t(f )] needs then to be included in the integrand of the scalar product( 72) that
  leads to determination of the elements of the Fisher information matrix. This double numerical integration,

  which needs to be carried out to high accuracy in order to keep under control numerical instabilities that

  occur otherwise in the numerical inversion of jk, makes the computational time very long, due to our limited
  computational resources. We have checked for a few (random) choices of the source parameters that including

  p[t(f )] does not change in any appreciable way the result. This is to be expected. For the physical parameters
  considered in this paper the Thomas precession phase contribute to  1 wave cycle, out of a total  1500. It

  also represents a secular increase in the phase of the GW signal, qualitatively not different from the one given

  by (f ).

· We consider the fiducial sources to be at redshift z = 1 [55]. As the systems are at cosmological distance,
  the values of all the physical parameters entering the GW signal presented in the previous sections must be
  considered as the observed ones; they differ from the values of the parameters as measured in the source rest
  frame by a factor (1 + z); the parameters are "Doppler-shifted" according to:

f    (1  f  z)  ,
         +

t  (1 + z) t ,

M  (1 + z) M ,

m  (1 + z) m ,

µ  (1 + z) µ .                       (80)

· We assume that the instrument observes the whole final year of in-spiral; the GW's sweep therefore the frequency

  band between the arrival frequency fa and the final cut-off frequency fisco; fa is determined so that after 1 yr,
  as measured by an observer in our solar system, the GW instantaneous frequency reaches fisco:

Tobs = t(fisco) - t(fa)              (81)
       = 1 yr = 3.1556926 × 107 sec

The range fa  f  fisco determines the integration domain in (75); values of fa and fisco for selected choices
of the source parameters are given in Table I. Note that we do not impose a low-frequency cut-off to LISA; this

choice is based on the fact that the real low frequency noise wall of space-based instruments is not very well
understood at the moment, placed somewhere in the range 10-5 Hz - 10-4 Hz.

· The total noise that affects the observations is given by the superposition of instrumental sources and astro-
  physical foregrounds of unresolved radiation due to (mainly) galactic white dwarf binary systems [53, 54], the
  so-called "confusion noise". The total noise spectral density Sn(f ) is therefore the sum of these two components,
  and we use the analytical approximations given in [26, 55] .

· Out of the 17 parameters on which the most general waveform depends, the signal h~()(f ; ) that we consider
  here depends on 12 independent parameters. In our analysis we adopt the following choice of independent
  parameters: ln M and ln µ (mass parameters), cos N , N , cos J , J , and c (geometry of the binary with
  respect to the detector),  and  (spin parameters), ln DL (distance of the source) and finally tc and c.

· We compute the expected mean square errors j2 1/2 and the angular resolution N for the case of
  observations carried out with one detector and with combined observations of both detectors I and II. The

FIG. 2: The probability distribution of N (left) and DL/DL (right), for observations of the final year of in-spiral of a
binary system with m1 = m2 = 106 M at z = 1. The histograms show the result of a Monte-Carlo simulation, where 1000

sources have been randomly located and oriented in the sky. The bottom panels refer to measurements carried out with only

one detector, whereas the top panels describe the results obtained by combining the two independent data streams. The plots
compare the errors for different values of the BH spins: S/m2 = 0.9 (solid line), 0.3 (dotted line), and 0 (dotted-dashed line).

analysis is done in the the frequency domain: we first compute analytically the derivatives h()/j, where
j = 1, .., 12, then compute numerically jk and jk, Eqs. (75) and (76); the integration and matrix inversion

are performed using numerical routines of the NAG library.

LISA parameter estimation strongly depends (the results vary by orders of magnitude) on the actual value of the

signal parameters. In particular, one of the key set of parameters that affect the errors is the location and orientation

of a source with respect to the detector. This represents already a large parameter space that one needs to explore

in order to obtain meaningful results. We perform this exploration by means of Monte-Carlo simulations, which

therefore affect the way in which the results are presented, given in terms of probability distributions. For each set

of physical parameters, we select randomly the 5 geometrical parameters (N , N , J , J and c) from a uniform
distribution in cos N , N , cos J , J and c. The Monte-Carlo simulation is done on 1000 different sets of angles.
As far as the other 7 parameters are concerned we chose them as follows. We consider a fiducial source at redshift

z = 1, with m1 = m2 = 106 M (which sets the 3 parameters DL, M and µ), with tc = c = 0. We fix the tilt angle
parameter  = 0.9, and we explore three different values of the size of the spin S: (i) S/M 2 = 0.95, (ii) S/M 2 = 0.3

and (iii) S = 0. Notice that given m1, m2, S and  we can easily derive . It is worth noticing that in this paper we
do not explore the effect of the tilt angle cos-1 , which is also likely to affect the errors. Such analysis is currently

in progress [37]. We would also like to stress that for the case S = 0 the waveform that we actually consider is the

one corresponding to the non-precessing restricted 2PN approximation (this is the waveform used in [30], very similar

to the one used in [26], which is the non-precessing restricted 1.5PN approximation). This is equivalent to assuming

that we know a priori that spins are zero and the binary system does no precess. Note that this is different from

estimating the source parameters using the waveform (68) where precession is included, and assuming S  1. In the

case S = 0 we need to estimate only 11 parameters, and not 12. The reason of this choice is to compare existing

results in the literature with our new ones that take into account spin-orbit modulations.

Figs 2, 3 and 4 summarise the key results. Figs 2, 3 show the probability distribution of the parameter errors, for

N , DL/DL, M/M and µ/µ. Fig 4 shows the cumulative probability distributions: if we define   j ,
                           0
the plots show P ( < 0) =  0  p()d    as  a  function  of   0.  Each  plot  compares  the  non-spinning  case  with  the  cases

FIG. 3: The probability distribution of M/M (left) and µ/µ (right) for observations carried out with only one interferometer
(bottom) and the two combined LISA outputs (top). The parameters are the same as in Fig 2.

in which the black holes are spinning with two different value of the spins, S/M 2 = 0.95 and 0.3 .
   The key result, which is absolutely clear from Figs 2, 3 and 4 is that the errors in the spinning-case are smaller

than in the non-spinning one, even if the number of parameters that one needs to estimate is greater (12 instead of
11). One can intuitively understand this behaviour by looking at Figure 1, which shows the amplitude and phase
evolution of the signal recorded at the LISA output: precessing binaries show a much greater richness of features than
non-spinning sources. These are the features that help in measuring the parameters.

   However, despite all the parameters are estimated with smaller errors with respect to the non-spinning case, there
is striking difference between the "position parameters" ­ location in the sky and luminosity distance ­ and mass
parameters. In fact, the errors N and DL/DL are reduced by a factor 2-to-10 depending on the actual value
of the source parameter. We know that LISA reconstruct the position of the source in the sky by exploiting the
modulation in the amplitude and phase of the signal, and precession introduces one additional modulation effect
which can improve the determination of N^ and de-correlates DL from M, which improves the measurement of the
luminosity distance. Still, the change of position and orientation of LISA is the main effect that allows the source
to be located. The improvement in N and DL/DL is however significant: the fraction of sources that can be
located within, say, one square degree is 10% for non-spinning binaries, 35% for binaries with 0.3 and 50% with 0.95
(for  = 0.9). The systems whose distance is known to better than 1% is about 60% for non-spinning binaries, and
essentially the totality for spinning binaries.

   The situation is radically different for the masses: in the non-spinning case the instrument reconstructs the value
of the two mass parameters by staying in phase with the GW phase, whose time evolution is mainly controlled by M
(the leading Newtonian term) and, to a less extent, by µ, through the post-Newtonian corrections, cf Eqs. (23), (70)
and Table I. M and µ play no role in the amplitude and phase modulation, Ap(t) and p(t), Eqs (50) and (51). As
a consequence, M is measured much more accurately, by a factor  100 or more, than µ, see Fig (3) and [26, 30]. If
spins are present, the masses start to play a role also in Ap(t) and p(t), because they control the rate at which L
and S precess, and therefore are responsible for the intrinsic amplitude and phase modulation of the signal. This has
two effects on the parameter estimation: it de-correlates M from µ (at the Newtonian order the two mass parameters
are even degenerate) and provides new features in the measured signal that improve the parameter estimation. The
net effect is that the errors in M and µ are now of the same order, with a drastic improvement with respect to the
non-spinning case, of by a factor  50 and  103 for M/M and µ/µ, respectively; M/M is still  3 times
smaller than µ/µ, due to the role played by M in the GW phase (t). It also clear that the additional signature

produced by the masses on the amplitude and phase modulation helps in removing the correlation between M and
DL, therefore reducing DL/DL, as we have already mentioned.

   To summarise, the parameters of two 106 M black holes spiralling toward the final merger at z = 1, and rapidly
rotating, say S/M 2 = 0.95 and  = 0.9, can be measured very accurately: M and µ can be measured to a few
parts in 105, the luminosity distance to better than 1% (in some cases almost 0.1%), and with an error box in the
sky 10-6 srad < N  10-3 srad. Notice that the errors scale with the distance roughly as N  1/DL2 and
M/M  µ/µ  DL/DL  1/DL. This would be strictly true for white noise, which is not the case for LISA.
In particular going to higher redshift, one can expect a degradation of the measurements more severe than the one
predicted by this simple scaling, because GW's are red-shifted to lower frequencies where the noise is higher and some
initial portion of the signal falls out of the observational window.

   For multi-band, electro-magnetic and gravitational, observations of the same event the key parameter is the instru-
ment's angular resolution. In fact there is some hope that LISA will have enough angular resolution to locate the
galaxy or galaxy cluster where a coalescence of massive black holes takes place; this would enable other telescopes to
be pointed at the same area of the sky and to observe the aftermath of such catastrophic event. However, previous
studies [26, 27, 29, 30] have concluded that this might actually be impossible for sources at z  1 (or beyond),
because of the poor angular resolution of GW observations. In short, the results of our analysis suggest that in some
exceptional case LISA might be able to identify the host galaxy cluster of a MBH binary of 106M at z = 1, but in
general the LISA error box will contain several hundreds of galaxy clusters and > 105 galaxies, all of them potential
hosts of a LISA detected source. Such conclusion can be easily derived by comparing the LISA angular resolution
with the one of other telescopes and the angular size of galaxies at high redshift. An optical telescope, such as the
Keck telescope, has a field of view of about 1 square degree. Chandra has a square field of view of 16 × 16 arcmin with
a spatial resolution of  1 arcsec, and XMM has a circular field of view with radius 15 arcmin and a spatial resolution
of a few arcsec. INTEGRAL has an even wider circular field of view ­ the radius is 10 degree ­ with a poorer spatial
resolution (12 arcmin). There is therefore no doubt that, for a typical LISA source at z = 1, GW observations will
provide information accurate enough to cover the interesting portion of the sky with a single observation by one of (or
all) the former instruments. At z = 1, the typical size of a galaxy is  3 arcsec and the typical size of a galaxy cluster
is  2 arcmin. In a very few lucky occasions LISA will be able to detect a source with N  3 × 10-3 deg2, but more
typically the angular resolution is N  0.3 deg2, and could be much worse for a few detections (N  5 deg2). It
is therefore clear that for the "high spatial resolution" GW detections, only  3 galaxy clusters will fall in the LISA
                                                                                                                                                       20

error box, but more typically the number of clusters will be  300. If there is still a small (but not negligible) chance
of identifying the galaxy cluster hosting a GW source, the chances of pin-pointing the host galaxy seem to be very
bleak (the former numbers need to be multiplied by a factor  103 for galaxies).

                                                                     VI. CONCLUSION

   We have considered LISA observations of massive black hole binary systems in the final stage of in-spiral for
rapidly rotating black holes. We have restricted our analysis to comparable mass objects in circular orbit, modelling
the radiation at the restricted post1.5-Newtonian order assuming simple precession. We have derived read-to-use
analytical expressions for the signal registered at the detector output, both in the time and frequency domain, and
have determined the mean-square-errors associated to the parameter measurements for equal mass 106M binary
systems at z = 1 for selected spin parameters and a wide range of source locations and orientations. Our analysis
clearly shows that the presence of spins reduces (by orders of magnitude, for some parameters) the errors with which
the source parameters are measured. LISA is therefore a more powerful telescope than previously thought if spins
play a significant role. The main shortcoming of our analysis is the limited region of the parameter space that we
have been able to explore, which is entirely due to our limited computational resources. Such analysis is currently
in progress [37]. Of particular interest is the exploration of the parameter space in the case where the masses are
not comparable, i.e. the mass ratio is  0.1 or smaller. Our present understanding of the relevant astrophysical
scenarios suggests, in fact, that the formation of unequal mass binaries should be regarded as the rule rather than the
exception. When the mass ratio increases, the number of precession cycles detected at the LISA output will increase
as well, cf. Table II and Eq. (39). It is therefore conceivable that precession will be even more effective in breaking
the degeneracy among the parameters, in particular the two masses. However the amount of intrinsic rotation S shall
also play a crucial role, as the number of precession cycles is proportional to S. Preliminary results suggest that for
m2/m1 = 0.1 and rapidly rotating systems (S/M 2  0.9) the estimation of the mass parameters and the angular
resolution improve by a factor of a few, with respect to the equal mass case, provided that the signal-to-noise ratio is
not strongly affected. In general, in fact, unequal mass systems will be detected at a lower SNR, so that precession
compensates for the loss of SNR. The latter eventually dominates the effect of rotation when m2/m1 decreases further
and compromises the accuracy with which parameters can be measured.

[55] In this paper we are mainly concerned with a comparison of the errors obtained without considering spins with the ones

      that are given when spins are included in the signal. It is therefore clear that the actual redshift (distance) of the fiducial
      source and the choice of the expected noise spectral density (instrumetal noise and confusion noise) have little interest, as
      far as the same values are used in the two cases.
