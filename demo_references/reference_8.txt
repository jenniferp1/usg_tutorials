Mothers' and fathers' cultural socialization and bias preparation with older (M 5 13.9 years) and younger
(M 5 10.31 years) siblings were studied in 162 two-parent, African American families. Analyses examined
whether parental warmth and offspring age and gender were linked to parental practices and whether parents'
warmth, spouses' racial socialization, or youth age or gender moderated links between racial socialization and
youth outcomes. Parental warmth was linked to parents' socialization. Mothers engaged in more socialization
with older offspring, and fathers more with sons. Mothers' cultural socialization was positively related to youth
ethnic identity and fathers' was negatively related to youth depression symptoms. Youth exhibited a lower locus
of control when mothers were high but fathers were low in racial socialization.
