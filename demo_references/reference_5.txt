CYBER TERRORISM- GLOBAL SECURITY THREAT

Mitko BOGDANOSKI,
Drage PETRESKI1

                   Abstract: It is more than obvious that the way of conducting terrorism
with the time

                   is becoming more sophisticated. The cyber terrorism is real threat to
fast technology

                   development. Potential targets are systems which control the nation's
defenses and

                   critical infrastructure. The terrorist of the future will win the wars
without ﬁring a shot

                   - just by destroying infrastructure that signiﬁcantly relies on
information technology.

                   The fast growth of the Internet users and Internet dependance dramaticly
increased

                   the security risks, unless there are appropriate security measures to
help prevention.

                   To understand cyber terrorism it is important to look at its background,
to see how the

                   terrorist organisations or individuals are using the advantage of new
technology and

                   what kind of measures governments and international organizations are
taking to help

                   the ﬁght against cyber terrorism.

                   Key words: syber, attack, security, terrorism, DoS

Introduction

             Although there are a number of deﬁnitions which describe the term terrorism,
one of the
deﬁnitions that are frequently encountered is that terrorism is "the unlawful use or
threatening use
of force or violence by a person or an organized group against people or property
with the intention
of intimidating or forcing societies or governments, often for ideological or
political reasons." 2

             Interactions between human motives and information technology for terrorist
activities in
cyberspace or in the virtual world can be addressed as cyber terrorism. Yet this is

                                                                 Page 1

the deﬁnition of
cyber terrorism that Sarah Gordon and Richard Ford from Symantec have used in their
efforts to
deﬁne "pure Cyberterrorism." 3

             The cyber terrorism as a concept has various deﬁnitions, mostly because
every expert in
security has its own deﬁnition. This term can be deﬁned as the use of information
technology by
terrorist groups or individuals to achieve their goals. This may include the use of
information technol-
ogy to organize and execute attacks against networks, computer systems and
telecommunications
infrastructure, and to exchange information and perform electronic threat. This kind
of security

        threat can manifest itself in many ways, such as hacking computer systems,
programming viruses

        and worms, Web pages attack, conducting denial of service (DoS) attacks, or
conducting terrorist

        attacks through electronic communications. More common are claims that cyber
terrorism does not

        exist and that actually it is a hacking and malicious attacks. Those who
support these claims do not

        agree with the term "terrorism" because if we take into account the current
technologies for preven-

        tion and care, the likelihood of creating fear, signiﬁcant physical damage or
death among population

        using electronic means would be very small.

                   Considering the fact that the terrorists have limited funds, cyber
attacks are increas-

      ingly attractive, because, their implementation requires a smaller number of
people and

      certainly smaller funds. Another advantage of cyber attacks is that they allow
terrorists to

      remain unknown, because they can be very far from the place where the act of
terrorism is

      committed. Unlike the terrorists that place their camps in countries with weak

                                                                 Page 2

governance,

      cyber terrorists can store anywhere and remain anonymous.4 It is believed that
the most effec-

        tive use of cyber terrorism is when it is used in combination with physical
terrorism. For example,

        disabling the operation of emergency services in situations where the need for
deployment of such

        services is caused by the use of physical terrorism is really an effective way
of pooling of mentioned

        types of terrorism. There are huge possibilities of conducting cyber terrorism
through Internet using

        advanced technology.As possible targets of cyber terrorism can be considered
government computer

        networks, ﬁnancial networks, power plants, etc., and the reason for this is
that the terrorists identi-

        ﬁes all the above as most suitable targets to be damaged or put out of
operation in order to cause

        chaos. Systems manipulation through "secret entrance" software, stealing
classiﬁed information,

        data deletion, Web sites damaging, viruses inserting, etc. are just a few
examples of how terrorists

        can enter into the secured system. The terrorist attacks enabled by computer
technology can be also

        conducted through the air trafﬁc control system or rby emote damage of the
power supply networks.

                       The new information technologies (IT) and the Internet are more often
used by terrorist

        organizations in conducting of of their plans to raise the ﬁnancial funds,
distribute their propaganda

        and secure communications. Director of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA),
George Tenet, in

        his statement in 2000 for global security threats, explained that the terrorist
groups including Hez-

        bollah's, Hamas and al-Qaeda, for support of their operations, use computerized
ﬁles, e-mails and

        protection (encryption). The convicted terrorist Ramzi Yousef, the main planner
of the attack on the

        World Trade Centre in New York in encrypted ﬁles in his laptop computer stored
detailed plans for

        aircraft destruction in the United States.5

                       The terrorist organizations also use the Internet to "reach out" their
audience, without need

        to use other media such as radio, television or holding various press
conferences. Web pages are

        used as a way to highlight injustice and to seek support for as the call
"political prisoners" wich

                                                                 Page 3

        are "illegaly captured". Typical Web pages will not display any information
related to the violent
        activities and will usually claim to be left with no other choice but to resort
to violence. They claim
        to be persecuted, that their leaders have been targets of assassination and
their supporters were
        massacred. They use this tactic to give impression that they are weak and to
present themselves as
        outsiders. This public performance is a very easy way to recruit supporters and
members. Besides
        propaganda, on the terrorist organizations Web sites can often be found content
and instructions on

how to make explosives and chemical weapons. This allows them to identify the most
common users
that can have sympathy for their cause and because of that this is an effective
method for recruiting.

             This also helps individuals acting as terrorists to engage in terrorist
activities. In 1999, a ter-
rorist named David Copeland killed 3 people and injured 139 in London. He did this
with the help
of bombs placed in three different locations. At his trial it was discovered that he
used Terrorists
Manual (Terrorist Handbook - Forest, 2005) and How to Make a Bomb (How to Make Bombs
-
Bombs, 2004), which had downloaded from the Internet.6

           Cyber terrorism

           The terrorists use cyberspace to cause uncertainty. They, for their own
reasons, are
struggling against state authorities and governments and use all available means to

                                                                 Page 4

achieve
their own aim. Cyber attacks occur in two forms, one used to attack data, and others
focused
on control systems. 7 Data theft and destruction leads to service sabotage and this
is the
most common form of Internet and computer attacks. The attacks focused on the
control
systems are used to disable or manipulate the physical infrastructure. For example,
you can
perform remote power supply networks, railway and water supplies in order to achieve
a
negative opinion on larger geographic areas. This is accomplished by sending data
over the
Internet or by penetrating security systems. These weak spots in the system were
used in the
incident in Australia that occurred in March 2000, where disgruntled employee (who
failed
to provide full-time employment) used the Internet to slip one million liters of
unprocessed
sewage into the river and coastal waters in Queensland.8 In fact, after 44
unsuccessful
tries, the 45th was successful. The ﬁrst 44 trials were not detected at all.

           After the September 11 attacks, the auditors of public safety are worried
because
the most critical infrastructures are owned by private companies, which are not
always
interested in possible security threats.

           In 1988, a terrorist guerrilla organization, within two weeks, ﬂood embassies
of Sri Lanka with 800 email-s a day. The message which was appearing was "We are
the Internet Black Tigers and we are doing this to disrupt your communications." De-
partment of Intelligence characterizes the attack as the ﬁrst known terrorist attack
on
government computer systems.

           Internet saboteurs in 1998 attacked Web site of the Indian Bhabha Atomic Re-
search Centre and stole e-mails from the same center. The three anonymous saboteurs
through online interview claimed that they protest against recent nuclear explosions
in India. 9 In July 1997, the leader of the Chinese hacker group claimed that
temporarily
disallowed Chinese satellite and announced that hackers set up a new global
organization
to protest and prevent investment by Western countries in China.

           In September 1998, on the eve of parliamentary elections in Sweden, saboteurs
attack
the Web site of the right-wing political party in Sweden and created a link to a Web

website of
the Mexican government in protest against government corruption and
censorship.Analysts
point out these crime examples as low level information warfare.

           Romanian hackers on one occasion managed to intrude into the computer systems
controlling the life support systems at an Antartic research station, endangering
the 58
scientists involved. Fortunately, their activity is stopped before any accident
occurred.

           During the Kosovo conﬂict, Belgrade hackers conducted a denial of service
attack
(DoS) on the NATO servers. They "ﬂooded" NATO servers with ICMP Ping messages,
typically used for diagnostic or control purposes or generated in response to errors
in IP op-
erations.

           During the Palestinian-Israeli cyber war in 2000 similar attack has been
used. Pro-
Palestinian hackers used DoS tools to attack Israel's ISP (Internet Service
Provider), Netvi-
sion. Although the attack was initially successful, Netvision managed to resist
subsequent
attacks by increasing its safety.

           Also inApril 2007, numerous journalistic organizations associated with the
"Associ-
ated Press" reported that cyber attacks on critical information infrastructure on
Estonia is
conducted by computer servers located in Russia, although it was later determined

                                                                 Page 6

that it is
a Distributed DoS attacks carried out by different locations around the world (U.S.,
Canada,
Brazil, Vietnam and other locations). Of course, the locations of the computers
involvedin
the attack do not always shows the location of the direct participants in the
attack. It is
actually the location of the so-called "zombie" machines that act as intermediaries
during
the attack, without their knowledge or without any knowledge of the direct
attackers. The
attack completely put out the function of the Web sites of many governmental, media
and
ﬁnancial institutions and leads to diplomatic talks which was a reason to examine
the pos-
sibility of creating a NATO-supported research center capable of identifying the
source of
cyber attacks. InAugust 2008, a similar attack was conducted against Georgia. It is
assumed
that the attack was perpetrated by Russian hackers.

           In October 2007, hackers attacked the Web site of Ukrainian President Viktor
Jush-
enko. The responsibility for this attack took over the radical Russian nationalist
youth group,
the Eurasian Youth Movement.10

           An analyst from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) publicly revealed
that in January 2008, hackers successfully stopped power supply networks in several
U.S. cities. In November 2008, the Pentagon had a problem with cyber attacks carried
out by computer virus, prompting the Department of Defense (DoD) to take unprec-
edented step of banning the use of external hardware devices, such as ﬂash memory
devices and DVDs. 11 Ofﬁcially, U.S. never felt cyber terrorist attack.

           One of the examples that have caused global panic occurred in late 2008, when
a
group of hackers called "Greek Security Team", "intrude" into CERN computer systems
(European Center for Nuclear Research) so deep, that they were very close to take
control

accelerator.

Hackers broke into the system on the ﬁrst day of the experiment and placed a fake
page on
the site of CERN, whose aim was to defame the experts responsible for computer
system,
calling them "a group of students." CERN ofﬁcials said that it was not caused any
damage,
but knowing that the detectors and all valuable equipment is vulnerable to digital
threats
is really uncomfortable.

           Methods and techniques of the cyber terrorism

           As we already explained, except for offencive operations the terrorist can
effectively
use the cyberspace for secure communications. 12

           Information security is of great importance to many organizations, including
the
terrorists. The reason for this primarily lies in their malicious activities, so it
is obvious that
they will be faced with a well-equipped government security forces and coalition
forces,
that can easily reveal their intentions through the interception of communication
using
sophisticated monitoring equipment.

           This problem is well known for the terrorist organizations, which is the
reason for
them to pay great attention to security aspects during the transmission of subtle
information.

           "Al Qaeda Training Manual" is just one of the many evidence of the commitment
of terrorist organizations for safe communication. Notably, among the most important
and
most extensive lessons described in this guide are two lessons that provide guidance
on
the proper usage of communications and data protection. Special emphasis on this
issue
is placed in the thirteenth lesson "Secret Writing and Ciphers and Codes" which aim
is to
train potential members of this terrorist organization for secure data transmission.

           Data hiding by the members of terrorist organizations is revealed on many
occasions,
but for sure it can be said that the number of cases where the data transmission
covered
using steganographic methods is not registered by security services is much larger.

                                                                 Page 8

           Evidence for the use of steganography by al-Qaeda terrorist organization is
the ar-
rest in Berlin in 2012 of a 22 year old Austrian who had just arrived from Pakistan.
Later
it was conﬁrmed that he is a member of this terrorist organization. The digital
storage and
memory cards he tried to hide were password protected and the information were
invisible.
After the initial analysis it was found that inside memory cards was buried a
pornographic
video "Kick Ass" and a ﬁle named "Sexy Tanja". A few weeks later, after great
efforts to
combat a password and the software to make the ﬁle almost invisible, German
researchers
encoded in the video of a treasure trove of intelligence - over 100 documents
including
al-Qaeda ﬁrsthand about some of the plots of the terrorist group and a bolder road
map for
future operations for which there were not speciﬁed neither the date nor the
location. Also
various terrorist training manuals used by this organization were found. All these
data were
hidden using steganographic tools.

           Spain, similar to the UK legislation, restricts the activities of any
organization that
is directly or indirectly related to the ETA (Euskadi Ta Askatasuna) - an armed
separatist
group for Basque Homeland and Freedom. The European Council took steps to establish
the
wanted level across Europe and to deﬁne the term "terrorist crime." Germany's
government
cuts the limits about monitoring telephone calls and monitoring e-mails and bank
accounts
and restores previously limited communication between the Secret Service and the
police.
In June 2002, the United Kingdom, under the pretext of counter-terrorism, tried to
bring
regulations that would mandate almost all local and national government agencies to
gain
access to data communications trafﬁc without the need of a warrant. 16

           Australia introduced a law on terrorists in order to intercept electronic
mail (giving
power to the main Australian Security Intelligence Organisation), and to create an
attack
directed against the preparation and planning of terrorist acts. This law allows the

terrorist
property to be "frozen" or taken away. New Zealand has introduced similar
legislation in
order to comply with the bilateral agreement on legal harmonization between these
two
countries.

           India also brought its own decree to protect against terrorism, enabling
authorities to
apprehend suspect without trial, to conduct surveillance and to seize money and
property
of suspected terrorists, and in some cases to implement the death penalty.17

           Some states, such as is the case with the U.S. and Australia, recommended
setting
of network operation center in cyberspace, which will include Internet service
providers,
and developers (programmers) of computer hardware and software.

           Their task is to develop safe technology, as intelligent analysis software,
that will be
able to analyze existing data, both public and private, in order to detect
suspicious activities.18

with the

in
efforts to transform the military organization and conduct of operations by
"networking

November
2002, NATO leaders decided to strengthen its capabilities to defend against cyber

                   After the cyber attack against Estonia in April and May 2007, NATO
ministers

      agreed on the outline of the NATO's cyber defense concept, which was brought in
      Nordwijk, in October 2008.21 This concept at the beginning of 2008 was developed
      into a NATO Policy on Cyber Defense.22 The NATO members were informed in more
      details about this policy on the NATO Summit held in Bucharest at the beginning
of
      April 2008. 23

                   Following the Summit, NATO established Cyber Defence Management

related to cyber

      defense, and better management of the cyber defense support to any member of the
alliance

      in defense against cyber attack, upon request.24 At the same time, NATO leaders
agreed

      with the formal establishment of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Center of
      Excellence (CCD-CoE), which has been in development since 2004. The signiﬁcance
      of the CCD-CoE, based in Tallinn, was conﬁrmed during the attack of Estonia in
2007,
      so in October 2008 the NATO Council grants the Centre full NATO accreditation
and

security policy
in the UN system. Normally this refers to those debates related to the threat of
terrorism and
in the form of Resolutions of the UN Security Council. 27 The topic is covered in
the work
of the Counter Terrorism Committee established by Security Council,28 and it is
mentioned
in the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.

           In the latter case, the goal is not only "counter terrorism in all its forms
and manifesta-
tions on the Internet", but also with more active approach to "use the Internet as a
tool for
countering the spread of terrorism."29 Wider in the UN systems, cyber security is
regularly
recognized as a central feature that will be constantly developed in the
international agenda
for international security.

           In the UN system, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) has highest
responsibility for the practical aspects and applications of the international cyber
security.

           The ITU mission statement embraces the issue of cyber security in direct
terms. The
purpose of the organization is to develop conﬁdence in the use of cyberspace through
enhanced online security. Achieving of the cyber security and cyber peace are some
of the
most critical concerns in the ICT development, and ITU takes concrete measures
through
its Global Cybersecurity Agenda (GCA).30

           In September 2008, the ITU and the International Multilateral Partnership
Against
Cyber Threats (IMPACT) signed an agreement under which GCA is located in IMPACT
headquarter in Cyberjaya, Malaysia.31

                   OSCE's interest in the challenges of cyber security is increasing. In
December 2004,

      the OSCE Ministerial Council decided to dedicate to the "extent of use of the
Internet by

      terrorist organizations," including a number of activities, such as recruiting
of the terrorists,

ministers called for

      greater international cooperation and utilizing more effort to protect "vital
critical informa-

      tion infrastructures and networks from the threat of cyber attacks."

                   The participating countries were asked to closely monitor Web pages of

Minister Jaak Aaviksoo spoke about immense amount of work that has to be done in the
the ﬁeld of cyber security.38

           The OSCE's Forum for Security Co-operation (FSC) also contributed to the
organization's involvement in the ﬁeld of cyber security. Although the FSC's work
has been concentrated largely on arms control, disarmament and conﬁdence-building
measures,39 lately, the forum began to be more interested in cyber security. In
October
2008, FBS (in joint session with the Permanent Council) decided to convene an OSCE
workshop on a Comprehensive approach to improving cyber security in March 2009.40
Finally, the OSCE supports national efforts, such as the Armenian Forces on Cyber
Crime and Cyber Security.41

           Contribution of the CoE in the international cyber security policy is
primarily through
the Convention on Cyber Crime, which was opened for signature in November 2001 and
which entered into force in July 2004. It is important to note that, although the
Convention
was signed by 46 countries, including Canada, Japan, SouthAfrica and the U.S., until
today
it has been ratiﬁed by only 26 countries, including Macedonia, Albania, Croatia,
Estonia,
Hungary, Lithuania, Romania and Slovenia, 11EU states have yet to ratiﬁed the
Convention
and ﬁve CoE member states have not even signed (including Russia). Convention was
signed
and ratiﬁed by countries that are not members of the CoE (Canada, Japan, South
Africa
and USA).42 Sixteen other countries that are not members of the Council of Europe
are
reported as "known to use the Convention as a guideline for their national
legislation"
(including Brazil and India).

           The CoE Convention on Cybercrime is important for several aspects. First, the
Convention addresses the illegal activities and practices that features across
spectrum
of cyber security threats. Second, the Convention establishes common standards and
procedures that are legally binding on its signatories. Third, the Convention is
open to
the Member States of the CoE and others, which increases its authority as an
interna-
tional instrument. Finally, the Convention introduced requirements for handling data
and access that have led to concerns about the privacy law and civil liberties.

      national organized crime. The purpose of this subgroup was to "enhance the
ability of the

      G-8 countries to protect, investigate and prosecute crimes committed using
computers,

      network communications, and other new technologies." The mission of the subunit
was

      subsequently extended to include the use of the Internet by terrorists and the
protection

      of critical information infrastructure. Subgroup is trying to deal with cyber
crime not only

      within the jurisdiction of the G8 countries, but also to create guidelines that
could take and

      implement other countries. The subgroup has created 24/7 network of contact for
high-tech

      crime and international Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CCIP)
Directory.

      Subgroup has published its best practice documents and guidelines for assessment
of threats

      to computer and network security and has organized international training
conferences for

      cyber-crime agencies.

                   Conclusion
                   This paper gives a short overview of the term of cyber terrorism and
describes the
      most known cyber terrorist attacks. Taking in considerationthe fact that the
cyber terrorists
      are using smarter methods and tools to attack computer systems and government
institu-
      tions, and the main objective is to achieve their objectives; the national and
global security
      are subject to higher risk.
                   The second part of the paper represents a response to the cyber security

                                                                Page 20

challenges

      at national level and by various international organizations. NATO, for example,
is a long-

      standing political and military organization, with extensive experience in the
ﬁeld of cyber

      terrorism and cyber security.
                   One of the limitations that occur during the acquisition of various

cyber security
      measures is a balance to be made between security measures and civil liberties.

There
      should be also a balance between the provision of speciﬁc interests to a

particular organiza-
      tion or government, and more general requirements for the beneﬁt of all

legitimate users
      to be formed an international communications and technological environment that

will be
      unfriendly-orriented to the ambitions of cyber terrorists and extremists, cyber

criminals
      and hackers.
